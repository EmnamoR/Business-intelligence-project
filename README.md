Extract, transform and load data , create the data warehouse , analysis
and reporting for Biat Big data + Data Mining



BIAT wants to set up tools to retrieve, consolidate, operate and present automatically and securely teleclearing data (checks, transfer, withdrawals and effects) from different application sources.
A highly dynamic market, changing client demands, fierce competition, the necessity of strict control and risk management are only some of the characteristics of the business environment where modern banks such as Biat conduct their operations. Better management and better decision-making process make the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful on the market with these characteristics.
Business intelligence solutions for banks should provide the decision makers from all business segments of a bank with the ability to manage and exploit information resources, in order to solve the problems and make timely and high-quality decisions.
Business intelligence systems in banks must be comprehensive and yet simple for the end user. Business intelligence covers many areas of the bank.
Data warehouse and online analytical processes (OLAP) form the informational basis for the application of business intelligence.
Data mining and knowledge retrieval are also important segments of business intelligence and deal with complex statistical analysis, discovering “hidden’” relationships between data and forecasting the behavior trends of business systems.
